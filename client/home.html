    <p>Maximilian is a C++ audio library that is designed to be easy to use and teach with. It has a
    bunch of interesting features. It doesn&#8217;t use blocking, instead relying oon the compiler to
    do neccessary optimizations. This makes it easy and flexible, both in terms of development and use.</p>
